\tightlist
\item
  Rename this file
  \texttt{\textless{}FirstLast\textgreater{}\_A01\_Introduction.Rmd}
  (replacing \texttt{\textless{}FirstLast\textgreater{}} with your first
  and last name).
\item
  Change ``Student Name'' on line 3 (above) with your name.
\item
  Work through the steps, \textbf{creating code and output} that fulfill
  each instruction.
\item
  Be sure to \textbf{answer the questions} in this assignment document.
\item
  When you have completed the assignment, \textbf{Knit} the text and
  code into a single PDF file.
\item
  After Knitting, submit the completed exercise (PDF file) to the
  appropriate assigment section on Sakai.

\hypertarget{install-tinytex}{%
\subsubsection{Install TinyTex}\label{install-tinytex}}

Now, run this code cell the same way. This will install ``tinytex'' -- a
helper app that allows you to knit your markdown documents into
professional quality PDFs.

\hypertarget{set-your-default-knit-directory}{%
\subsubsection{Set your default knit
directory}\label{set-your-default-knit-directory}}

This setting will help deal with relative paths later on\ldots{} - From
the Tool menu, select \texttt{Global\ Options} - Select the RMarkdown
section - In the ``Evaluate chunks in directory'', set the option to
``Project''

\hypertarget{discussion-questions}{%

  What are your previous experiences with data analytics, R, and Git?
  Include both formal and informal training.

\begin{quote}
Answer: I took an Introduction to Statistical Modeling course during the
spring of 2020 (what became my COVID semester) during my time as an
undergrad at the University of Richmond. I downloaded and used RStudio
off my laptop for the first time ever to complete take-home assignments.
However, once the class went completely remote, we were no longer
expected to use R for the completion of assignments, and I did not
retain my familiarity using it! I am eager to ease back into it this
semester. Additionally, I was given a very brief introduction to using
Google Earth Engine for a Remote Sensing course my last year at
Richmond. I have no experience with Git.

\item
  Are there any components of the course about which you feel confident?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{quote}
Answer: I am confident that I will learn a variety of new tools and
approaches for data wrangling, analysis, and preparation that will
benefit me moving forward - with my MP, future GIS classes, and
potential career!

\begin{enumerate}

\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  Are there any components of the course about which you feel
  apprehensive?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{quote}
Answer: I am somewhat apprehensive of not having an in-person class
aside from our lab sections during which I would have the ability to see
you (Dr.~Fay and Dr.~Lima) and ask questions about issues I have
encountered while doing work for the course. I am still getting used to
the role of TAs (they were less common/available to me at the University
of Richmond), and I have the tendency to want to resort to the
professors first before consulting others about issues/troubleshooting!

\hypertarget{github}{%
\subsection{3) GitHub}\label{github}}

Provide a link below to your forked course repository in GitHub. Make
sure you have pulled all recent changes from the course repository and
that you have updated your .Rmd file, committed those changes, and
pushed them to your GitHub account.
